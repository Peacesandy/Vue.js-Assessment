# Vue.js-Assessment
A simple Vue JS application that displays a list of investment funds. The application should allow users view details of a fund and also provide basic filtering functionality.

# Overview
### Users should be able to
- See the list of funds on a page, showing the name, returns, asset type, fund manager, and risk level.
- See a details page where more information about the fund would be displayed (composition, custodian, description, performance).
- Filter funds based on their risk level.
